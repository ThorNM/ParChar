# HOW TO RUN:

1) Push the "Download zip" button in GitHub.

2) Unzip the file in a FOLDER on your computer

3) Make sure the Bins.mat file is in the same folder as the ParChar file

4) Leave the ImRec and imoverlay_orig functions in the same FOLDER or put it in a folder that is on the Matlab search path

5) Run Matlab

6) Set the FOLDER as current directory

7) Type CompatibilityTest to run a small script that checks if you have the correct setup

8) Type “edit ParChar” (or edit ParChar_mult if working with multiple images) to open the script in the editor

9) Specify the input values and run the code
